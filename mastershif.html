      <h5>Chicken Biriyani</h5>
      <p> I have been sharing varieties of (Vegetarian)Veg biryani recipes in my blog under “Sunday Lunch Recipes”. I hope many of you had found it useful and tried them too.
</p >
<p>I am planning to compile list of all the biryani recipes under one page for easy and quick reference. But before that I want to make a post on list of spices used in most of the biryani along with pictures and names in different languages like English, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Tamil for people to identify & buy them easily in your place. I have also shared their health benefits so that you can enjoy your biryani without any guilt.</p>
<p>All these informations are collected from Internet. Please leave your feedback in comments if you feel anything important is missed or mispelt. I will add them. Thanks !</p><br><br >

      <h5>Chicken Gravy</h5>
      <p >I have been looking for a chicken gravy for pulav, naan which is thick, little on the sweeter side and little spicy and masala like. Finally my athai (aunt) gave me a recipe for the delicious chicken gravy and ghee rice which is served in wedding. Immediately I tried it and loved it to the core.</p>
      <p >This is a very Easy Chicken Gravy that you can make quickly and it goes well with both rice and roti. Both hubby and mittu are not fond of nonveg dishes – I like to eat occasionally so the demand for cooking nonveg dishes is absolutely nil at home. Now that gugu is fond of eating nonveg I have started to try new recipes and as a bonus to post it here too.</p>
      <p >Now lets get on to check how to make this Easy Chicken Gravy. So this is for all the readers who wanted me to post more chicken recipes often. You can make this gravy in pressure cooker which will save more time but in one pot method taste the flavour and taste is more.</p>
